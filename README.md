# Env

This repo will house my configuration, scripts, and environment for my main compute environment. 

Higher Level Specification

* [ ] Public repo for ease of access, but with mechanisms to keep offline secrets
* [ ] Modular s.t. for example I can choose to pull down or install my gaming environment or an esp32 dev environment
* [ ] On disk encrypted home drive (at least)
* [ ] Act as the "brief case" i.e. given some init requirements such as a generic nix image of version X installed on the hardware, having this repo should allow me to recreate my environment.
* [ ] Offline secrets have import / export mechanisms
* [ ] Backup and Restore Policies
* [ ] Home drive decryption on log in, encryption on log out
